## custom-grid-framework
This project attempts to design a custom Grid-based Framework.
To ShowCase this grid framework we tried to build a clone of the odin Project website which can be found here for comparison:

### Live version of the clone Link on Github Pages: https://kudjieraymond.github.io/custom-grid-framework/.



========================================================

To test this framework on your project, clone the repo , add the file "framework.css" located in the "styles" folder to your stylesheets in your html header

To view the clone framework on your local machine, clone the repo and then open the index.html  file in the odin-project folder in Chrome browser.
